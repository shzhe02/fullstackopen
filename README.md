# Full Stack Open (2022/2023)

A repository for the Full Stack Open coure offered by Helsinki University (also known as CS-E4675 for Aalto University)

Note: All directories with "sandbox" in the name are meant for either following along with the non-exercise parts of the material or for allowing me to mess around with the code to gain better understanding. **Nothing within those folders should be assessed.**
